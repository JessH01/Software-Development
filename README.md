# Software-Development
This is a mock up of a tool for a municipal pot hole management tool that was the completion of the Software Development course.
The challenge was a system with two different methods of access, one for an employee, one for a citizen.  The tool needed to allow citizens to report potholes 
and any damage sustained by them.  On the employee side, there needed to be a way to review the prioritized potholes and assign crews and track repair costs.  
Additionally, there needed to be a means to review the damage costs and update or not that they had been reimbursed.

All coding was performed in Python, using PyCharms.
